### 2.1 Scanning Instructions
1. Tap the green **Camera / Scan** button in the bottom floating navigation bar.
2. Position the medicine packaging inside the viewfinder rectangle.
   - **For Blister Strips:** Turn the foil side toward the light so the embossed or printed expiration stamp (`EXP`, `BB`, `B.No`) is clearly visible. Our in-memory pre-processor automatically applies an adaptive contrast curve to reduce foil reflections.
   - **For Syrup Bottles or Boxes:** Align the primary label showing the brand name and dosage strength (e.g., `Augmentin 625 Duo`, `Dolo 650`).
3. Tap **Capture / Scan Label**.
4. The scanner automatically detects:
   - **Medicine Name & Formulation:** (e.g., *Paracetamol 500mg*, *Amoxicillin & Clavulanate*).
   - **Dosage Strength:** (e.g., *650mg*, *10ml*, *500mcg*).
   - **Normalized Expiration Date:** Automatically parsed into `YYYY-MM-01` ISO format.
   - **Form & Quantity:** Form type and estimated unit count or bottle volume.
5. Review the extracted fields in the confirmation modal. Tap any field to make manual corrections if desired, then tap **Save to Vault**.

### 2.2 Offline Scanning Fallback
If you are traveling or lack internet connectivity, DawaSnap AI seamlessly falls back to on-device scanning using client-side text recognition and our offline rule-based reference engine. Zero bytes leave your device in this mode.

## 3. Manual Medicine Entry & Form Selection

   - 💧 **Liquid:** Antiseptic washes, topical lotions, gargles.
   - 🌿 **Other:** Inhalers, eye/ear drops, ointments, sprays.
4. Set the **Quantity** (units remaining in pack) and **Expiration Date**.

   - **Email Expiry Alerts:** Toggle automated email dispatch on or off.

## 4. Medication Vault Management & FIFO Batches

### 4.1 First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Batch Grouping
When you purchase multiple strips of the same medication over several months, DawaSnap AI groups them under a single clean medicine card while maintaining independent batch expiration tracking:
- **Nearest Expiry First:** The batch closest to expiration is always displayed prominently with an urgent colored badge.
- **Quick Deduct (-1 Button):** Tapping the `-1` button automatically deducts from the oldest active batch first, encouraging you to consume near-expiry pills before opening fresh stock.

### 4.2 Filtering & Category Organization
Use the top filter bar to instantly organize your vault:
- **All / Active:** View currently usable medications.
- **Liked / Starred:** Quick access to daily maintenance medicines.
- **Expiring Soon:** Highlights medicines expiring within your configured threshold (e.g., within 30 days).
- **Clinical Categories:** Filter by therapeutic class (*Heart, Pain Relief, Antibiotics, Diabetes, Vitamins, Digestive, Allergy, Respiratory, Mental Health, Skin Care, Eye & Ear*).

### 4.3 Dose Tracking & Intake History
Every time you take a dose or edit an entry, an immutable audit event is recorded in the medicine's history log (`CREATE`, `EDIT`, `MARK_TAKEN`, `DELETE`). Tap any medicine card and select **View History** to inspect adherence logs.

## 5. Expiration Monitoring & Multi-Stage Alerts

DawaSnap AI features an automated multi-stage safety alert policy to ensure zero expired medications remain in household cabinets:

```
[Timeline to Expiration]
       │
       ├─► 30-31 Days Remaining: STAGE 1 — 1 MONTH ADVANCE NOTICE (Plan refills)
       │
       ├─► 7 Days Remaining:     STAGE 2 — 1 WEEK URGENT WARNING (Physician renewal)
       │
       └─► 0 to -14 Days:        STAGE 3 — EXPIRED ADVISORY (Do Not Consume & Safe Disposal)
```

### 5.1 Automated Email Delivery (Resend API & Google Cloud Scheduler)
- Automated alerts are sent from `DawaSnap AI <alerts@noorpos.in>` (or `onboarding@resend.dev`).
- **Cloud Run & Cloud Scheduler Architecture:** The backend service is hosted on Google Cloud Run (region `asia-south1`). Google Cloud Scheduler periodically triggers the authenticated cron endpoints (`POST /api/cron/check-expiry` and `POST /api/cron/sync` with `x-cron-secret`) to evaluate expiry milestones and synchronize records without requiring persistent idle server processes.
- **Atomic Deduplication:** Alerts are tracked on the server to guarantee strictly **one email per medicine per stage**. You will never receive repetitive duplicate emails for the same batch.
- **Safe Chemical Disposal Guidance:** When a medicine expires, the email provides critical safe disposal advisories (e.g., participating in pharmacy take-back drop-offs, mixing with coffee grounds in sealed pouches, and strictly avoiding flushing down household plumbing).

## 6. Daily Dose Alarms & Android Exact Timers

### 6.1 Exact Alarms (`USE_EXACT_ALARM`)
On Android 13+ and 14+, daily intake reminders require exact alarm scheduling:
- Local dose alarms are registered directly with the Android system's native `AlarmManager`.
- **100% Offline Precision:** They function independently of internet connectivity and wake the device precisely at your prescribed intake time.

### 6.2 Cloud Push Notifications (FCM)
For expiration warnings and multi-device sync, DawaSnap AI supports Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Configure permissions in **Settings** → **Browser / System Notifications**.

## 7. Drug-Drug Interaction Checker

When managing concurrent medications, hidden pharmacological contraindications can cause adverse events:
1. Tap the **Assistant** tab or select **Check Interactions**.
2. DawaSnap AI automatically screens all active medications in your vault (minimum 2 medicines required).
3. The screening engine evaluates:
   - **Severity Level:** 🟢 Low, 🟡 Moderate, or 🔴 High.
   - **Clinical Mechanism:** Why the two active ingredients interact (e.g., competitive CYP enzyme inhibition, additive bleeding risk).
   - **Actionable Recommendation:** Guidance to discuss with your prescribing physician.

*Clinical Disclaimer:* The interaction checker is an educational screening aid and does not replace the professional clinical judgment of your doctor or pharmacist.

---

## 8. AI Pharmacist Companion ("Dr. DawaSnap")

Your interactive, family-doctor-style companion is available 24/7 in the **Assistant** tab.

### 8.1 Key Capabilities
- **Vault-Aware Context:** When you ask, *"What painkillers do I have?"* or *"Do I have anything for a dry cough?"*, Dr. DawaSnap meticulously cross-references the actual inventory in your vault first before suggesting general over-the-counter options.
- **Multilingual & Hinglish Support:** Dr. DawaSnap natively understands English, Hindi, and **Hinglish** (e.g., *"Aapko ye Paracetamol din mein do baar khana khane ke baad leni hai"*).
- **Consultation Reports:** Tap **Send Consultation Report** to receive a structured digital summary of your chat and current medication inventory delivered directly to your verified email address and in-app Treatment Mailbox.

- **Export to CSV:** Tap **Settings** → **Export Data (CSV)**. Downloads a cleanly formatted `.csv` file compatible with Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, and Google Sheets.
- **Import from CSV:** Easily restore or batch-load medicines from a spreadsheet by uploading your `.csv` file.

---

## 10. Data Privacy, Local Storage & Account Deletion

### 10.1 Zero Cloud Image Storage
Medicine packaging photographs are stored exclusively in your local device's browser/phone sandboxed **IndexedDB** (`DawaSnapLocalImages`). They are **never** uploaded to cloud databases or remote storage buckets.

### 10.2 Soft Delete vs. Permanent Purge
- When you delete a medicine, it enters **Recently Deleted** for a 15-day grace period. You can restore it at any time.
- After 15 days (or if you click *Permanent Delete*), the medicine, its entire intake history subcollection, and its local photo are permanently erased.

### 10.3 Complete Account Deletion
In accordance with Google Play Store Policies and the India DPDP Act 2023, you can permanently wipe your account and all data:
- **In-App:** Go to **Settings** → **Danger Zone** → **Delete Account & All Data** → Type `DELETE`.
- **Web Portal (Without App Installed):** Visit `https://dawasnap.vercel.app/delete-account` to submit an instant or email-based deletion request. All cloud documents, push tokens, server schedules, and local caches are permanently purged within 48 hours.

## 11. Troubleshooting & Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q1: Why didn't my camera recognize the expiration date?
- **Answer:** Embossed foil stamps (stamped directly into metallic blister foil) often lack contrast under direct overhead light. Tilt the strip at a 45-degree angle so shadows highlight the raised digits, or tap manual entry to type the date in seconds.

#### Q2: Are my dose alarms affected by phone battery saver modes?
- **Answer:** Some Android manufacturers (Xiaomi, Samsung, OnePlus) enforce aggressive background task killing ("Doze Mode"). To guarantee alarms fire on time, go to your phone's **Settings** → **Apps** → **DawaSnap AI** → **Battery** → select **Unrestricted**.

#### Q3: How do I change my primary notification email?
- **Answer:** Open **Settings** (gear icon) on the top bar, update the email address field in your profile card, and tap **Save Settings**.

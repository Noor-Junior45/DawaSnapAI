ALL INTERACTIONS WITH THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PHARMACIST ("DR. DAWASNAP"), ON-DEVICE OCR EXTRACTORS, DRUG INTERACTION SCREENERS, EXPIRY MONITORS, OR NOTIFICATION GENERATORS ARE AUTOMATED, ALGORITHMIC, AND FOR PERSONAL REFERENCE ONLY.

### 1.3 Non-Substitute for Professional Medical Advice
THE SERVICES AND GENERATED CONTENT DO NOT CONSTITUTE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS, MEDICAL ADVICE, PHARMACOTHERAPY TREATMENT, INDIVIDUALIZED PRESCRIPTION VALIDATION, OR DOSAGE RECOMMENDATIONS. NEVER DISREGARD, DELAY IN OBTAINING, OR ALTER PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, OR TREATMENT PLANS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR REGISTERED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER, ATTENDING PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL CLINICIAN, OR LICENSED PHARMACIST BASED ON ANY INFORMATION, OUTPUT, SCHEDULE, OR WARNING DISPLAYED BY DAWASNAP AI.

## 2. SERVICES DESCRIPTION & TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DISCLOSURES

### 2.1 Scope of Services
DawaSnap AI provides users with a digital utility suite including:
1. **Medication Inventory Vault:** Secure cataloging of medication trade names, generic salts, dosage strengths, formulations (tablets, syrups, capsules, ampules), remaining stock counts, and manufacturer expiry dates.
2. **On-Device OCR & Visual Classifier:** In-memory pre-processing and optical character recognition running via native platform bridges, client-side Tesseract.js (WebAssembly), and heuristic packaging classification.
3. **Adherence & Expiration Reminders:** Local alarm scheduling for daily dose schedules and cloud-assisted multi-stage expiration warnings (dispatched at 30 days, 7 days, and expiration date).
4. **Drug Interaction Screener:** Algorithmic cross-checking of concurrent medications for reported clinical drug-drug interactions and pharmacological precautions.
5. **AI Pharmacist Companion ("Dr. DawaSnap"):** Interactive conversational assistant delivering general pharmacological compendia summaries, lifestyle tips, and medication inventory search assistance.

### 2.2 Artificial Intelligence & Third-Party LLM Disclosures
DawaSnap AI utilizes a hybrid dual-layer clinical assistance framework:
- **Cloud Reasoning Layer (Google AI Studio Gemini API):** For complex pharmacological interactions, multidrug regimens, and detailed usage instructions, queries are transmitted over encrypted TLS channels to Google Gemini models (`gemini-2.5-flash`). You acknowledge that prompts are de-identified (all personal identifiers stripped), and that cloud AI outputs may reflect latency, external service interruptions, or algorithmic hallucinations.
- **On-Device Reference Engine:** For fast, offline clinical consultation and offline label extraction, the application embeds an offline, rule-based clinical formulary and reference engine. The reference engine operates completely locally in device memory, with strict zero training on user conversation data.

### 2.3 Algorithmic Hallucination & Accuracy Disclaimer
You explicitly understand and accept that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs) generate probabilistic text. While trained on pharmaceutical compendia, AI models may occasionally generate inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or hallucinated clinical assertions, incorrect dosage equivalencies, or inappropriate contraindications. DawaSnap AI makes no representation, warranty, or covenant regarding the absolute accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any AI-generated response. You assume all risk arising from reliance upon AI-generated advice.

## 3. HARDWARE PERMISSIONS, NOTIFICATIONS & NETWORK USAGE

### 3.1 Notification Permissions (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`) & Delivery
DawaSnap AI utilizes standard local and push notifications to deliver scheduled medicine expiration warnings and dose alerts. In compliance with Google Play Store exact alarm policies, DawaSnap AI does not require or request restricted exact alarm permissions (such as `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`). Notifications are dispatched through standard Android notification channels and Web Push.

### 3.2 Camera Permission (`CAMERA`) & Image Architecture
- The camera permission is invoked solely when you initiate optical scanning of a medication box, bottle, or foil strip.
- **Local Vault Storage:** Saved medication photos are stored 100% locally in your device's sandboxed `IndexedDB` storage (`DawaSnapLocalImages`). They are **never** uploaded or saved to remote databases, S3, or Firebase Cloud Storage.
- **Online OCR Stream:** In online mode, the captured frame is streamed ephemerally over encrypted TLS 1.3 to the backend proxy and Gemini 2.5 Flash for multimodal character recognition, processed in server RAM, and immediately garbage-collected without server disk caching.

### 3.3 Push Notifications (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`) & Transactional Email
- The application requests push notification permissions to deliver expiration warnings and dose alerts. DawaSnap AI maintains a strict zero-marketing guarantee: we never broadcast advertisements, commercial promotions, or sponsored push notifications.
- When enabled in settings, transactional email alerts (30-day notice, 7-day warning, safe chemical disposal advisory) are dispatched via authenticated transactional infrastructure (Resend Inc.) strictly once per medicine stage.
